					"content":"After noticing a lack of introductory computer science opportunities and programming competitions in the Pittsburgh area, a friend and I co-founded HackNA—a twelve-hour hackathon taking place at my high school. A hackathon is a competition during which teams design, develop, and build software or hardware hacks (e.g. websites, robots, Android/iOS apps) on site and compete to win sponsored prizes and awards. The event, on December 16, 2017, plans on bringing together about 350 middle and high school students from schools across Pittsburgh in order to foster a high school tech community. Moreover, the event is designed so that absolutely no prior experience is necessary! We’ll be providing mentor expertise and optional workshops to help beginners get started and experts excel."

In response, I founded Code One, an organization centered around increasing computer science exposure in my community. Partnered with Millvale Community Library, Code One organizes programming lessons in public locations every week after school for middle and high school students. Lessons first begin with Scratch, a simple drag and drop programming language designed to familiarize students with computer logic, and then progress onto Python, a versatile language with easy-to-learn syntax."

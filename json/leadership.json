					"content":"After noticing a lack of introductory computer science opportunities and programming competitions in the Pittsburgh area, a friend and I co-founded HackNA—a twelve-hour high school hackathon located at my high school. A hackathon is a competition during which teams design, develop, and build software or hardware hacks (e.g. websites, robots, Android/iOS apps) on site and compete to win sponsored prizes and awards. The event, on December 16, 2017, plans on bringing together about 350 middle and high school students from schools across Pittsburgh in order to foster a high school tech community. Moreover, the event is designed so that absolutely no prior experience is necessary! We’ll be providing mentor expertise and optional workshops to help beginners get started and experts excel."

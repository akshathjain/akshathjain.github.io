					"content":"After noticing a lack of introductory computer science opportunities and programming competitions in the Pittsburgh area, a friend and I co-founded HackNA—a twelve-hour hackathon taking place at my high school. Hackathons are great ways to introduce more people to computer science and robotics—teams have twelve hours to design, develop, and build software or hardware hacks (e.g. websites, robots, Android/iOS apps) on site and compete to win sponsored prizes and awards. The event, on December 16, 2017, brought together over 200 community members from more than 25 school districts across Pittsburgh, including 15 companies and 5 sponsors in order to foster a high school tech community. <br><br> The event was specifically designed so that absolutely no prior experience was necessary! We coordinated with local companies who sent professionals to help mentor teams, judge projects, and teach workshops ranging from “Intro to Programming” to “Android Development”—all to help beginners get started and experts excel. <br><br> In fact, after receiving an overwhelming amount of positive community support and feedback, we decided to host a “mini” version of HackNA later this year in May specifically for beginners and middle school students."

In response, I founded Code One, an organization centered around increasing computer science exposure in my community. Partnered with Millvale Community Library, Code One organizes programming lessons in public locations every week after school for middle and high school students. Lessons first begin with Scratch, a simple drag and drop programming language designed to familiarize students with computer logic, and then progress onto Python, a versatile language with easy-to-learn syntax."

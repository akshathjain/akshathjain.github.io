So far, we have had sessions at Millvale Community Library and we plan to hold lessons at more locations in the future! Lessons first begin with Scratch, a simple drag and drop programming language designed to familiarize students with computer logic. Students then progress onto Python, a versatile language with easy-to-learn syntax."

			"title":"Personalized Privacy Assistant Project: Internet of Things Assistant",
			"description":"There currently exists no mechanism for individuals to determine the presence of Internet of Things (IoT) devices around them. Moreover, the ability for individuals to understand, control, and configure how their data is collected and processed by these devices is impractical, if not impossible. And with the increasing ubiquity of IoT devices, a solution is paramount. This is where the Internet of Things Assistant (IoTA) comes in. The IoTA is a part of the Internet of Things Privacy Infrastructure (IoTPI) — a scalable paradigm where system administrators can list all nearby IoT devices and where end-users can view, manage, and opt-in/out of data collection, empowering individuals to retake control of their data. This presentation highlights the progress made by the Personalized Privacy Assistant team in delivering a working prototype of the IoTA app.",

			"title":"The Correlation Between Internet Speeds and Obesity Rates",
			"description":"With a growing obesity epidemic across the United States, its important to identify various factors in order to ameliorate the issue. This study attempts to pinpoint the effect of one variable, internet speeds, on obesity rates. Therefore, H¬0 is that there is no correlation between obesity and internet speeds (⍴XY = 0). At both the local (Pittsburgh, PA) and national levels, I found that both obesity (local: p<0.0001, national: p<0.0001) and internet speeds (local: p=0.024, national: p<0.0001) are highly correlated with income. As such, I analyzed aggregate data as well as income-grouped data based upon the Federal Poverty Level (FPL), established as $12,060 for a single person household. Median household incomes—for both neighborhoods and states—were divided by their respective average household size to normalize the dataset (i.e. all incomes in the analysis are relative to the FPL of a single person household). I conclusively determined that while both obesity and internet speeds are correlated to income, there is no correlation between obesity and internet speeds at either a local, or national, level using both aggregate and FPL-grouped data.",

			"description":"During the 2016 – 2017 school year, I expanded upon my previous project – Lexical Syntax Analysis for Hostile Behavior Identification – in order to add more features and make the classification algorithm more robust. While my previous project was focused more upon linguistic queues to identify potentially dangerous accounts, this project also incorporated image recognition to extract features such as the number of people per image, average age, and auto-generated image caption. These parameters (27 in total) where then inputted into an artificial neural network to correctly identify the hostility and threat of an account.",

			"description":"During the 2015 – 2016 school year, I created a machine learning algorithm that would collect user data from Twitter, process that data to determine linguistic patterns, and classify accounts as being related to possible terrorist accounts. This project arose from the necessity of an algorithm to quickly and effectively monitor social media to remove terrorist accounts, especially since 90 percent of terrorist communications happens through that medium. My algorithm analyzed account features such as the most common words, account interaction patterns, and geolocational probability. If implemented, this tool could serve as an early warning system designed to mitigate hostile threats.",

			"description":"During the 2014 – 2015 school year, I created and tested IRES, a device that would intelligently track a user’s presence at a computer in order to limit computer power consumption by automatically issuing a series of commands that would either turn off the computer screen, put the computer to sleep, or hibernate it depending on what function would optimize power savings while minimizing user frustration. IRES consisted of an Arduino Leonardo with an infrared sensor to track the user’s presence; the entire setup was encased a custom 3D printed capsule designed to attach to the top of the user’s computer.",
